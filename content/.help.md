This content module parses `.md` and `.yaml` files inside the content/directory and provides paths according to the directory structure
So if you had `content/index.md` the path would be `/`
if you had `content/about.md` the path would be `/about`
if you had `content/blog/index.md` the path would be `/blog`
Anything starting with a `.` is ignored, both folders _and_ files

Marking things with `_` means it's a partial content file

Partial contents are accessible in search and content lists, but are not displayed in content navigation

how this works
